# Prosper Loan Data Visualization.
## by Daniel Okello


## Dataset

> Prosper loan is a peer-to-peer lending platform that provides personal loans to individuals and businesses. The dataset contains over 113,937 loans issued by Prosper between 2005 and 2014. 


## Summary of Findings

> The analysis of the dataset and visualizations indicates that borrower characteristics and loan terms are related to interest rates of Prosper loans. Employment status is a significant factor that impacts both the original loan amount and interest rates of the loan.

> Employed borrowers are more likely to receive loans with lower interest rates and higher original amounts compared to unemployed borrowers. The loan term is determined by the borrower's credit score, with lower credit scores resulting in longer loan terms and higher interest rates.

> Additionally, the original loan amount is also related to interest rates, with higher loan amounts resulting in lower interest rates.

> I will add the findings to the presentation slides.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation I will focus on the relationship between the original amount, the interest rates and finally the borrower employment statuses. 
> I will plot a histogram for the interest rates for the loan borrowers, followed by a bar plot of the employment statuses.

> This will be followed by plotting a box plot to show the relationship between the employment statuses and the interest rates and finally plot a scatter plot to show the relationship between all 3 features, i.e. the original amount, the interest rate and the employment statues.
